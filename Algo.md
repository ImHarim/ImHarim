### Number Theoric

  - Divisor

    m|n, n=km 라고 한다. m is a factor of n; or n is a multiple of m
    a|b and b|a then, a=b; a|b, b = ak for some k; b|a, a = bk for some k. 

    Division algorithm: given any two positivie integers a and b, there exist integers q and respectively called the quotient and the remainder
     - a = bq + r, 0 <= r < b.
    
    This known as "division algorithm," even though it isn't real algorithm.
    gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a mod b)
